# The `create_current_weekly_report_mc` task and dependencies are part of the
# internal process at Mozilla to create an aggregated fuzzing coverage report
# on a weekly basis. For this purpose, a revision is fixed every week and all
# fuzzing tools perform a coverage run on the that revision (during the week).
# At the end of the week, the code below fetches all reports belonging to that
# revision (which is published as an URL) and aggregates them into a combined
# weekly report. You can use the same logic if you have a large project with
# multiple testing tools and would like to automate the process of generating
# a summarized report for your testing efforts.
