        This method tries to return reasonable diff hunk locations for each
        changed file in the given unified diff, where the locations refer to the
        version before the patch is applied. We define the location of a diff
        hunk as follows:

        - If the diff hunk adds and removes lines, then the location of the diff
          hunk is the set of lines which were removed.

        - If the diff hunk only adds lines, then we should consider the lines
          surrounding the added hunk as the location of the diff hunk.

        These definitions aim at trying to return locations that point to the
        faulty code, which can again be used for coverage analysis.

        Note that the heuristics used here are far from perfect and are only
        meant to aid manual inspection.
